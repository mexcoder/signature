# signature
A didactic example of public key (asymetric) cryptography for digital signature 
[![DepShield Badge](https://depshield.sonatype.org/badges/mexcoder/signature/depshield.svg)](https://depshield.github.io)

# instalation
clone this repo and install the dependencies using `pip install -r requiremets.txt` (using a virtualenv is strongly advised)

# Usage
You may call each individual signature algorithm file (addition ,product) to get a quick demo on console
you can also call `gui.py [algorithm]` where algorithm may be either addition or product this will give you a gui you can use to play with the keys and messages
